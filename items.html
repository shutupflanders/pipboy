		<div class="weapons-i" id="brass-k">
			<h2>Brass Knuckles</h2>

			Developed in antiquity, this weapon is nevertheless quite prevalent in the post-Great War wastelands. <br/>
			Despite the colorful name, "brass" knuckles are typically made from stainless steel, and take the form of four linked rings in a shallow convex 
			formation with a bumper attached to the concave face. <br/> The rings are slipped over a combatant's fingers with the bumper pressed into the palm of the hand. 
			When a punch is thrown, the brass knuckles take the majority of the impact impulse, 
			transferring much of the punch's kinetic energy to the target by way of the harder, smaller impacting surface of the metal knuckles. 
			This drastically increases the likelihood of serious tissue disruption and bone damage. <br/><br/>

			Realistically, while properly fitted brass knuckles can prove quite an asset in a brawl, improperly fitting brass knuckles can easily break 
			the user's fingers or cause severe bruising and edema in the fingers and palm. In terms of a wasteland weapon, however, a set of brass knuckles, 
			while little better than nothing, can nevertheless provide a combat edge. 
			<br/><br/>

		<div class="weapons-i" id="baseball">
			<h2>Baseball Bat</h2>

			The baseball bat is a common melee weapon found in the Wasteland. 
			The United States was stereotyped a patriotic country, so it's very logical to find them everywhere. <br/>
			While useful for close combat with raiders, they are not particularly effective against the more durable foes found throughout the Wasteland. <br/>

			All things considered, Fallout 3's baseball bat is a decent melee weapon for early use and helps to preserve ammunition when starting out in the wasteland. <br/>
			Later, much more powerful melee weapons become available, such as the ripper and Shishkebab. <br/><br/>
		</div>

		<div class="weapons-i" id="pistol">
			<h2>10mm Pistol</h2>

			After the phase out of the N80, the N99 sidearm became standard issue military gear. <br/>
			The N99 was known for its ability to survive in the harshest of conditions and in many tests, as the weapon was able to 
			reliably be restored to working condition after an extended period of time exposed to hard elements and without maintenance.<br/><br/>
			 
			The N99 proved to stand up to its claims and as a result, is one of the most common weapons found in use in the Wasteland. <br/>
			While many civilian weapons were ruined beyond use in the extreme conditions following the war, <br/>
			the N99 is commonly able to be easily restored to working order by anyone with even the most basic knowledge of firearm mechanics. <br/><br/>

			However, an N99 in poor condition can often deliver low target and armor penetration, frequent jamming, and greatly reduced accuracy. <br/>
			Fortunately, the weapon was produced in great numbers and units are available for replacement parts. <br/><br/>
		</div>

		<div class="weapons-i" id="hunting-r">
			<h2>Hunting Rifle</h2>

			This weapon is often the very first rifle type firearm the Lone Wanderer can acquire after leaving Vault 101 for the first time. <br/>
			(Although the BB gun is the first rifle to be acquired, the .32 hunting rifle is the first actual combat rifle acquired.)<br/>
			This weapon is very accurate, and has the best zoom aside from the scoped weapons. The standard hunting rifle has spread, unlike the sniper rifle 
			(and the hunting rifle's unique variant Ol' Painless). This can make the weapon hard to use for sniping at long ranges without V.A.T.S.. <br/>
			 A skilled player can use this weapon to great effect in most situations, even close quarters combat inside buildings. As always, its best to take cover between shots. <br/><br/>

			Unlike most guns in the game, this rifle is not self-loading (automatic)rather it is a bolt action type weapon. <br/>
			This weapon is best used at a safe range, point-blank, or on relatively weak NPCs. <br/><br/>

			It is coming apart and held together with duct tape and wire (while other weapons in the game are either rusted or scratched).<br/>
			Despite its appearance, a fully repaired hunting rifle can fire 666 shots, about 134 magazines, before breaking. <br/><br/>

			It is interesting to note that while this is a very accurate weapon, the in-game weapon model does not have rear or front sights, nor does it have a scope.<br/>
			In reality, this would make the weapon extremely difficult to aim at longer ranges and would render it almost totally worthless beyond close-range encounters, <br/>
			even to a skilled marksman. <br/><br/>
		</div>

		<div class="weapons-i" id="plasma-r">
			<h2>Plasma Rifle</h2>

			The plasma rifle uses microfusion cells, the same type of ammunition used by the laser rifle and commonly found throughout the Capital Wasteland, 
			and can discharge up to twelve green, self-illuminated plasma bolts before requiring a reload. <br/><br/>

			The plasma rifle fires projectiles that inflict potentially heavy damage at a fairly quick semi-automatic rate of fire. <br/>
			The plasma bolts moves at sub-sonic speeds, giving enemies the chance to dodge the plasma bolts. <br/>
			Because of this, the plasma rifle is most effective in close to medium range combat, as opposed to the laser rifle which is better suited to long range. <br/>
			Due to its fast semi-automatic rate of fire, it empties its 12-shot magazine rather quickly, and its reload time is somewhat 
			longer than most other small guns/energy weapons. Maintenance is a combination of perks and drawbacks: Like other energy weapons, 
			it has a high maximum condition compared to small guns, but is expensive and/or difficult to repair.<br/>
			A plasma rifle in poor condition (under 10%) can cost over 1000 bottle caps to repair. <br/><br/>
			The plasma rifle has twice the chance of inflicting a critical hit than most other weapons, and can turn enemies into piles of green goo if the 
			killing blow is a critical hit. Like all energy weapons, the plasma rifle's plasma bolt can ignite gas leaks.<br/><br/>

		<div class="weapons-i" id="fatman">
			<h2>Fatman (Mini-Nuke Launcher)</h2>

			The Fat Man has an estimated range of 150+ yards. The blast zone will be irradiated for a short time.<br/>
			The mini nuke projectile is very heavy, and if simply fired straight ahead, it will travel only a short distance before falling to the ground and detonating (causing you to be caught well within the very damaging mini-nuclear blast). <br/>
			For optimal range, the Fat Man should be fired in V.A.T.S. mode at high skill levels (which automatically compensates for the projectile's downward trajectory), or at an upward angle to catapult the mini nuke further so that it impacts at a safer distance. <br/><br/>

			The launched mini-nuke will fall if shot while in the air. <br/>
			The Fat Man's condition can wear down surprisingly fast with frequent use (though its firepower is still devastating at any state of repair). <br/>
