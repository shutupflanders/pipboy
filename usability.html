				<h2>Website Usability</h2>

				Usability is increasingly important in websites nowadays. The older and younger generations are starting to use computers more and more and it is important not to put them off using certain websites.
				<br/><br/>
				Below I have listed several points to avoid this and keep a good score on your website's useability.
				<br/><br/>

					<ol>
						<li>
							<h3>Use consistent intuitive navigation.</h3> 
							Users are impatient. They hate having to learn new site navigation. Make your navigation obvious and consistent throughout your site. 
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<h3>Have a consistent link back to the Home page.</h3> 
							There is nothing more annoying than having to click the 'back' button 300 times, let users navigate back to the start wherever they are. 
						</li>
					
						<li>
							<h3>Write for the Web.</h3> 
							You need text, but remember to break it up into easily skimmed topics. People will read a newspaper from front-to-back but tend to skim and jump around on a website. Make it easy for them to find what they want and get more info. 
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<h3>Proof-read.</h3> 
							Nothing says "amateur" like grammatical/spelling errrors. Have someone else read over your work to catch things you might have missed.  
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<h3>Web browser adaptability</h3> 
							Make sure your website can be viewed without errors on other browsers, some people still use Netscape.  
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<h3>Operating systems</h3> 
							Operating systems are in large supply, make sure your fonts and buttons are supported, if not allow alternatives to be used.  
						</li>
